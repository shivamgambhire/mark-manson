NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

From the author of the international mega-bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck 
comes a counterintuitive guide to the problems of hope.

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, 
healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably 
and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, 
and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, 
education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding 
feeling of hopelessness.
